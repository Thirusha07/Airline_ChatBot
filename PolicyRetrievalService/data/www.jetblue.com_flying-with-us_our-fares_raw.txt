Same-day switches (as well as same-day standby) are subject to a $75 fee (but no difference in fare), with the following exceptions: If you booked a Blue Extra fare, you can make same-day switches for free. (That’s no fee, no difference in fare.) Same-day switches or same-day standby are not allowed on Blue Basic Fares, even for Mosaic members. Please note that same-day switches (and same-day standby) are not allowed on Blue Basic fares booked on or after Mar 18, 2024.

Or, if you’re a Mosaic member, same-day switches can be made up to 24 hours before your scheduled departure. You must be switching to a different departure time (earlier or later) on the same day as the original departure. The origin and destination cities must remain the same, but you can change airports within the same city (so, for instance LGA to JFK). Of course, if the difference in fare is less than $75, you have the option of cancelling your flight and making a new booking to avoid paying the same-day switch fee. My travel plans may change.
