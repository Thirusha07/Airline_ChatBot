you booked a Blue Extra fare, you can make same-day switches for free. (That’s no fee, no difference in fare.) Same-day switches or same-day standby are not allowed on Blue Basic Fares, even for Mosaic members. Please note that same-day switches (and same-day standby) are not allowed on Blue Basic fares booked on or after Mar 18, 2024. To qualify as a same-day switch: The booking must be changed on the calendar day you were scheduled to depart, beginning at midnight in the time zone of the departure airport. Or, if you’re a Mosaic member, same-day switches can be made up to 24 hours before your scheduled departure. You must be switching to a different departure time (earlier or later)
